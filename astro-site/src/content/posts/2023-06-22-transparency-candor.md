But what keeps us going strong is the sense of togetherness, the spirit of camaraderie, the feeling that we're in it together, fighting the good fight, and celebrating our wins as a team. And you know what? It all boils down to one crucial thing: transparency and candor.

Sure, organizations sooner or later realize the importance of these values, but it better be sooner than later.  Especially in today's world of [remote work]({{<ref "2021-11-01-psychology-of-remote-working-and-16-tips-to-make-it-work">}}) and fierce competition for talent, we need to act fast. We need to create an environment where transparency and candor thrive, because that's what will make employees stick around.

Let’s have a look at  what transparency and candor really mean. In this post I try to explain the awesome benefits of having a culture that embraces openness and honesty. I also take a hard look at the challenges that come with adopting these values and figure out ways to overcome them. So, buckle up and let's dive into the world of transparency and candor. It's time to empower employees with [confidence and trust]({{<ref "/posts/2021-04-19-trust-and-growth-mindset">}}).

## It’s all about being transparent and candid

Candor, characterized by open and honest [communication]({{<ref "/posts/2021-06-08-communication-is-overrated">}}), and transparency, which ensures accessibility to knowledge for everyone, are two vital elements that, when combined, foster a culture of strong commitment among individuals, regardless of the situation.

### What does psychology say?
The psychological characteristics of transparency and candor provide valuable insights into their importance:

- From an evolutionary standpoint, humans have developed social dynamics that rely on effective communication and cooperation. Candor aligns perfectly with this evolutionary drive, as open and honest communication allows for the exchange of information, trust-building, and navigating social relationships efficiently. This, in turn, increases our chances of survival and reproductive success.
- Neurological studies have revealed that the brain processes honest and dishonest communication differently. Truthful interactions engage areas associated with cognitive control and self-referential processing to a greater extent. These findings suggest that honesty and candor are neurologically preferred modes of communication. When information is openly shared, neural circuits associated with trust, social connection, and collaborative decision-making are activated. Our brains are naturally wired to appreciate and value transparency in our interactions.
- Candor is closely tied to the concept of psychological safety, which creates an environment where individuals feel safe expressing their thoughts, ideas, and concerns without fear of negative consequences. Research highlights the essential role of psychological safety in fostering trust, collaboration, and innovation within teams and organizations. When people feel psychologically safe, they are more likely to engage in open and honest communication, contributing to the overall success and well-being of the group.

### Benefits of the transparent and candid culture

Now, let's explore the benefits of fostering a transparent and candid culture:

- **Establishing psychological safety**: Creating an environment where individuals feel safe to express themselves fosters trust and encourages open communication.
- **Fostering authentic leadership**: Authentic leaders, by leading by example, inspire trust and set the tone for open communication throughout the organization.
- **Constructive feedback and growth**: Encouraging a culture of constructive feedback allows for personal and professional growth, enabling individuals to improve and develop their skills.
- **Building trust and employee engagement**: Transparency and candor build trust among team members, leading to higher levels of employee engagement and commitment.
- **Nurturing innovation and collaboration**: An environment that values transparency and candor fosters innovation and collaboration, as individuals feel comfortable sharing ideas and perspectives.
- **Overcoming challenges together**: By embracing transparency and candor, teams can tackle challenges collectively, leveraging diverse viewpoints and finding effective solutions.

### Challenges of adopting transparency and candor

Despite the numerous benefits, certain barriers can impede the establishment of transparency and candor within organizations:

- **Fear of retribution**: Employees may hesitate to be candid due to the fear of negative consequences, such as retaliation or damage to their careers. Creating a culture that emphasizes psychological safety is crucial in mitigating this barrier.
- **Hierarchical structures**: Traditional hierarchical structures can inhibit open communication. Breaking down hierarchical barriers and promoting collaboration at all levels can foster transparency and candor.
- **Lack of psychological safety:** When individuals do not feel safe expressing their thoughts and concerns, it hinders open communication. Prioritizing psychological safety through trust-building measures is essential for overcoming this barrier.

By recognizing and addressing these barriers, organizations can actively cultivate a culture of transparency and candor, leading to enhanced collaboration, innovation, and overall success.

## How to build the culture of transparency and candor?

Transparency and candor are not mere buzzwords; they are essential elements for building thriving organizations that can adapt, innovate, and succeed in today's dynamic and competitive business environment. As we have just seen, these principles have deep roots in our evolutionary heritage and neurological foundations, making them crucial for effective social interactions.

To build a culture of transparency and candor within an organization, several key steps can be taken:

1. **Lead the change**: As a leader, it is crucial to set the example for the behavior you wish to see in others. Demonstrate transparency, open communication, and a willingness to engage in candid discussions. Your actions will inspire and influence those around you.
2. **Establish psychological safety**: Foster an environment where individuals feel safe to express their thoughts, ideas, and concerns without fear of judgment or negative consequences.

7. **Recognize and reward transparency**: Acknowledge and appreciate individuals and teams that exemplify transparency and candor. Celebrate instances where open communication leads to positive outcomes and improved collaboration.

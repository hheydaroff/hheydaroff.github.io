For people working in [remote setup]({{<ref "/posts/2021-11-01-psychology-of-remote-working-and-16-tips-to-make-it-work">}}), it is such an enlightening thing to get together physically with the people you see usually only on screen. The importance of a regular physical space meetings create a team bond that no virtual setup can enable, at least not in my opinion.

Group exercises, such as "defining [core values]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-27-defining-core-values-for-a-team">}})" or "focus of the year" or "way of working" workshops, have the potential to transform team dynamics and drive positive change. They help to foster collaboration, generate ideas and increase inclusion of individuals. However, to maximize their impact, it is crucial to follow up with actionable steps. 

By clarifying the purpose, capturing and documenting the output, analyzing and synthesizing the results based on common themes, patterns, and priorities, validating and refining with the team, creating an action plan, communicating and reinforcing, and monitoring progress, you can ensure that the outputs of workshop brainstorming events become a catalyst for meaningful change within your team.

Remember, the real value lies not in the workshop itself but in the actions that come afterward. Embrace the opportunity to turn ideas into reality and witness the transformative power of teamwork and collaboration.

I have been doing intermitten fasting (IF) since 2020. Like with almost every other new experiment I do, I started with the extreme version of IF, called one meal a day (OMAD). To make it even worse, I added on top of that the Ketogenic Diet. One day to the next, my eating habit fully changed. I went through the whole keto flu, hunger crisis, foggy brain, and finally, I did not have to eat breakfast or lunch anymore.

After losing some weight and gaining mental clarity, it became a routine and did not do any further change, neither to my body nor to my brain. It literally stopped doing anything. Then, one day I started to eat sweets again and after few weeks my weight went up. Then I stopped it again. Then I went to visit my family, and I shifted from OMAD to 16-8 (16 hours of fasting period followed by 8 hours of eating window). I gained weight again.

Other factors that influence body weight over which the individual has potential control include level of physical activity, diet, and some environmental and social factors. - [National Academy of Sciences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221834/)

Some people are lucky to have a good basal metabolic rate, or something else that burns their calories better or faster or in whatsoever efficient way that they are not gaining weight when eating a lot, even with a sedantic lifestyle. I, on the other hand, and probably many others like me are struggling with weight loss, even if I am walking at least 7-8 kms a day.

I've plateaued at losing weight with IF. I am pretty sure there is a constraint I am not considering. I know I am not exercising regularly. I would even say that I am exercising minimally. There is a reason for the lack of motivation to go to gym or do workout. My backpain is killing me. Especially when I am working out. So the pain is holding me back from doing it regularly. 

I need to identify this constraint, get to the root causes of it and try to fix them. I might not be lucky like others, but then I need to be more stubborn than the others and be more persistent in improving myself to become better than myself today.

In one of the organisations I had worked at there was a book club initiative. It was created by employees for employees. As a [book lover]({{<ref "/posts/2022-12-29-finding-joy-in-the-pages-my-top-5-books-of-2022">}}), I jumped into the circle. One of the books we had read was called "[Radical Candor](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/29939161)" by Kim Scott. The book offers a guide to effective leadership and management, focusing on how to build better relationships with your team members. The core concept of Radical Candor revolves around the idea of caring personally while challenging directly. 

In the book the author mentiones two employee personas that managers should be able to recognize in teams: "superstars" and "rockstars". Both of these personas are high performing individuals that add a big value with their distinct characteristics and makes an impact to the team and company culture.

Superstars are the high achievers who not only excel in their current roles but also have a strong drive for growth and leadership. They are very ambitious and constantly look for new challenges and opportunities to grow. They appreciate the recognition of their efforts and commitments, because they usually aim to make a significant impact to the organisational growth. Superstars are dynamic and adaptable, often thriving in environments that are fast-paced and constantly changing.

Rockstars, on the other hand, are the people are extremely competent and reliable in their domain expertise. They have a deep knowledge and skills in their specific area.Their performance is consistent and you can trust them to deliver results reliable. They tend to focus on their domain, preferring to perfect their craft rather than seeking constant recognition or career advancement. They are not necessarily looking to climb the corporate ladder aggressively.

A healthy workplace requires a mix of both personas. Rockstars ensure that the core work is done effectively and to a high standard, while superstars drive innovation and lead the way in terms of growth and development. However, it's important for managers to recognize and manage each type accordingly.

Superstars may be motivated by new challenges and opportunities for advancement, , either within the company or elsewhere. So, to keep them in the company, manager should make sure there is a recurrent career development possibilities for the superstars. 

Rockstars may require recognition through respect for their expertise and opportunities for deepening their knowledge. There are sometimes even "hard" rockstars. These are the people who usually are experts in their area, but they are not the most easygoing people to deal with. It is very challenging for the team and the leadership to fit that person into the team with a positive vibe. With the right approach, you can often leverage their strengths while mitigating the negative impacts of their behavior. You should understand what is driving them, what is their motivation. You should have a clear definition of their role and responsibilities. Have a regular open and candid dialogue. Support their growth, try to  encourage positive environment, and at the same ensure that they are not breaking the teams' code of conduct and collaborative spirit. 

Superstars and rockstars are both crucial to the success of an organization but contribute in different ways. Effective leadership involves understanding and leveraging the strengths of each type while providing the right environment and incentives for both to thrive.

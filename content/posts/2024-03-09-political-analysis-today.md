 Murphy's law  says:

 When I was a student, between 2012-2018 I have had a big interest in writing articles on political analysis. I was following all the [news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_21st_century), from [Euromaidan protests](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/understanding-ukraines-euromaidan-protests), [Greek Inflation Crisis](https://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8862583/greek-financial-crisis-explained), [annexation of Crimea](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26644082), to [Brexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit), [Donald Trump's presidency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/donald-j-trump/), [the rise and fall of ISIS](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-47210891), [U.S. starting to leave Afghanistan](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-taliban-peace-deal-agreement-afghanistan-war) which results into Taliban re-takeover, and many more that I had researched and written about. I even had a blog (Analyst Hub, later rebranded as Foreign Policy Magazine). 

 Then I moved on from university to career as a data scientist and then continued as a product owner. You can imagine that I invested much of my time and focus onto data science, machine learning and A.I. developments and implementations. With that I have been following the political and economic developments less and less. 

 Nowadays, as I am exposing myself to as much content as possible in spanish for advancing my spanish comprehension, I am reading news on a regular basis. With that, I see more updates on the political and economic situations and events. 

 For example, [Sweden's accession to NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52535.htm) on 07.03.2024 is a big one. After Finland, Sweden joining NATO, after overturning a position of [neutrality and military non-alignment that stretches back to the Napoleonic period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_neutrality) shows a significant shift driven by the need for greater security in light of Russia's aggression in Europe. Besides the collective defense guarantee under Article 5, Sweden's capable armed forces, robust defense industry and long-time experience in the Baltic Sea adds a strategic might to the NATO in the region. 

The overall situation in the region, even broader in the global scale is way too interesting not to follow closely. I am going to increase the share of my reading time to the political and economic developments. When thinking about it, the usage of some sort of knowledge graph (i.e. Obsidian) can be useful on organizing the information input, but I don't think I am really that ready to invest the time and energy onto another too. It will be hard to make it a [routine]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-11-daily-doses-of-deeds">}}).

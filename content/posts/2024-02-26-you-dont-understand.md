Imagine you are in a call with your manager discussing the way a critical project is moving forward. You are dealing with a [toxic stakeholder]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-15-dealing-with-toxic-stakeholders">}}) and you argue against the way it moves on. Then the manager respons with "you don't understand". At that point the conversation and the arguments of yours have no value against this, because you are in a [straw person](https://www.txst.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/straw-person.html) fallacy.

In discussions, especially in the ones that have a disaccord of the thoughts, it is important to put a proactive commitment to actively listen. It's significant to [understand the reasoning and the interests]({{<ref "/posts/2021-01-11-negotiation-a-skill-to-master">}}) of the person you are talking to. Ask clarifying questions. If that limited time is not enough, do not make a decision on your own and do a follow up. Chiefly when you are having the thought separation with your direct reports. 

Leadership sets the benchmark for the culture of communication within an organization. Encouraging open dialogue, showing appreciation for diverse viewpoints, and experimenting flexibility in communication styles can turn the "You don't understand" impasse into a collaborative effort to truly understand each other.

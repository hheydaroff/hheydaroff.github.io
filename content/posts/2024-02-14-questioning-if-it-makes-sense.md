I have written before my thoughts about the [point of living]({{<ref "/posts/2020-12-28-reflecting-on-the-point-of-living">}}), benefits of the [self-reflection]({{<ref "/posts/2021-01-04-how-self-reflection-leads">}}), and some other topics. Those topics come out of questioning things. Questioning and reflecting on our thoughts, actions, beliefs, observations do help us to differentiate meaningful from meaningless, the true value from the false illusion. 

The [repetition]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-11-daily-doses-of-deeds">}}) turns the uncomfortable and easy-to-forget things into a habit. Questioning things is not an exception. I believe one should spend on a daily basis at least 15-30 minutes to think about a topic of interest. It can be about how a person can have a high position at work knowing the person is an idiot, how children are playing in a park without being afraid of falling and hurting themselves, how you decided to live in an ugly city, what could be the next groundbraking technology after AR/VR headsets, or could it be that there is no an afterlife. These are just 5-6 topics out of millions you can come up every day. 

You might say it is not easy to find a topic to think about. I know. It sometimes ain't coming naturally if you do not enable this plasticity in the brain. I am trying this writing on a daily basis purely because of this reason. 

There is so much to think about. Some are short-term things that you can just think once and decide upon an action and just do it. There are some other things that needs to have some pre-requisites to be fulfilled before you can act upon. One of the most important pre-requisites for the majority of things is time,  or in other words the patience. It can be other stuff as well, like getting your bonus at work, or getting your citizenship, or getting a partner in life, or getting an academic degree, and so on. These may take some time. but we are forgetting things through time. Our long term memory is a  bit dumb usually. At least mine is very dumb. So, I need to do this questioning or reflection on a regular basis repetitively to not forget about it. 

One thing is clear to me that impacts all the decisions I make. Life is temporary and it can end any time. For me it is not important just to know it. I am reminding it to myself quite often.

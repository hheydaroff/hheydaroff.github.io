Keeping to-dos helps to organize and create focus for the given limited time period. There are many tasks that flow in non-stop. Some of those tasks are to be done urgently, some are important but not urgent, some are "waiting" tasks, some are to be delegated, and so on. 

As it is quite an important and an easy-to-excel-at skill to have, there are many tools that try to provide people with this magic power. My favorites are [Asana](https://asana.com/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). Not going to mention the reasons, maybe in another post I can do that.

I have realised that since recently I stopped using the to-do list on a frequent basis. The meetings, their notes, the documentation and so on I started to do on [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/). But not using any specific tool for my to-dos and topics anymore.

My current setup looks the like the following.I use calendar blocker for setting up any activity that requires at least 15mins of workload. Calendar blocker is also useful for clearing smaller tasks together in a speciifc time period. 

I used to use Asana for all types of task logging, but now I am having more picky way of inputting the tasks. To do that, I have integrated the to-do management into my frequent automatic acitivity. Browsing. I use the theme called [Bonjourr](https://bonjourr.fr/) and activated "notes" functionality which allows to write in `markdown` format. Using `[ ]` one can create a to-do item. Every time I open a new tab, guess what I see?! Yes, the to-dos of mine. I cannot easily forget or unsee what I've written. It helps a lot.

Next step is to somehow have a minimal `flag` that categorizes each note/item. More about it once I try it.

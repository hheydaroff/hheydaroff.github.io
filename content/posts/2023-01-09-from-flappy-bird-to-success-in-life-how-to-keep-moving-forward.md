Flappy Bird is a mobile game that was developed by Vietnamese video game artist and developer [Dong Nguyen](https://twitter.com/dongatory). The player must tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and fly up, navigating through a series of pipes that appear on the screen. The goal is to fly as far as possible without hitting any pipes or the ground. Each time the bird successfully passes through a pipe, the player's score increases. The game has simple graphics and players know it for its high level of difficulty.

If you have ever played the game, you know that it can be frustrating at times. You may fly high, only to suddenly plummet down. But despite the obstacles, you keep playing, trying to navigate through the pipes and achieve a new high score.

## Finding Equilibrium in Life's Flights

Life is also like Flappy Bird: sometimes you soar and sometimes you stumble. But at the end of the day, what truly matters is that you keep moving forward, one small milestone at a time. Hitting a rough patch or feeling like we're putting in a lot of effort without seeing much progress can easily discourage us. But it is important to remember that moving forward, no matter how small the steps may seem, is crucial for personal growth and success.

In Flappy Bird you notice that sometimes it takes more effort to get past a certain level, while other times you seem to breeze through without much effort at all? This can be true in life as well. There will be times when things seem to come easy and times when we have to work hard to make progress.

Sometimes we also should not flap our wings too hard, which may end up in also an unavoidable failure. Let us think of the immune system of our body. The immune system must find a balance between two opposing needs: the need to recognize and destroy foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria, and the need to recognize and protect the body's own cells. If the physical immune system is underactive, it fails to defend the body against micro predators and we become susceptible to infections or viruses. On the other hand, if the physical immune system is overactive, it mistakenly attacks the body and we develop autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a healthy physical immune system must strike a balance between these competing needs and defend the body effectively, but not too aggressively. In our lives, we should find a balance between flapping not too low and not too high.

But it's important to keep moving forward, because even when things seem difficult, it's often in those moments that we are growing the most. It's easy to get complacent when things are going well, but it's in those times when adversities challenge us that we have the opportunity to learn and improve.

### Pursuing Passion and Progress

One of the most important things in life is [finding your passion and purpose](https://heydaroff.info/2021/02/01/reflecting-on-passion-and-perseverance/). What drives you and gives your life meaning? When you are able to connect with your passions, it can give you the motivation and resilience to overcome any obstacle. Once the passion is there, we should put the effort onto practicing it.

[Developing habits](https://heydaroff.info/2021/01/18/what-does-our-brain-tell-us-about-habits/) is also crucial for personal growth and progress. Habits are like the wings of Flappy Bird – they keep you moving forward and help you achieve your goals. Whether it's waking up early, exercising regularly, or setting aside time for personal growth, establishing good habits can make all the difference. More practice we accumulate, the more neural circuit generated in our brain, and the more automatic our habits become.

### Overcoming Challenges and Embracing Mistakes

Of course, it's not all smooth sailing. There will be obstacles and challenges along the way. But it's important to remember that these are just temporary setbacks. Just like in Flappy Bird, one has to navigate through the pipes and keep moving forward.

[Mistakes maketh the evolution](https://heydaroff.info/2021/04/05/reflecting-on-making-mistakes/). Making mistakes is a natural part of the journey. It's okay to make mistakes – in fact, it's often through our mistakes that we learn the most. So we shouldn’t let fear of failure hold us back. So don't be afraid to take risks and try new things. You never know what amazing things may come from them. Embrace the mistakes and use them as opportunities for growth!

### Developing Grit and Perseverance

[Perseverance](https://heydaroff.info/2021/02/01/reflecting-on-passion-and-perseverance/) is also an essential quality of moving forward. It is our mind skill to [delay the gratification](https://heydaroff.info/2021/03/30/delayed-gratification-is-it-even-worth-it/), [self-criticise](https://heydaroff.info/2021/01/04/how-self-reflection-leads/), self-regulate and train our emotional strength for the sake of a greater purpose – following our passion. It's not about being perfect or never making mistakes, but about how we bounce back from those mistakes and continue moving forward. Just like in Flappy Bird, you have to keep flapping your wings and try again, even if you have to start over a few times.

## Keep flapping your wings

Life is like the game Flappy Bird – there will be ups and downs, but the key is to keep moving forward. It's important to find your passion and purpose, develop positive habits, and persevere through challenges and setbacks. Making mistakes is a natural part of the journey, and it's through these mistakes that we often learn the most. So don't let fear of failure hold you back, and remember that the only way to lose is to give up. Keep flapping your wings and you will surely soar.

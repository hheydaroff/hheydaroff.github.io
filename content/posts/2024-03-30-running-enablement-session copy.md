“a single thing can have two kinds of description and reality.” We can think of matter as waves or particles, but not both at the same time. Similarly, the micro world of quantum physics follows different laws than the macro world of classical physics. “They inhabit different layers of description,” Mr. Gazzaniga writes, “and one is not reducible to the other.” Once we accept that humans contain layers of physical organization, none of which can be wholly reduced to another, it is no longer puzzling that what goes on in the brain can have an objective, physical description and a subjective, mental one.

Cambrian explosion, that sudden flowering of complex forms some five hundred million plus years ago. The key finding by the authors is the development of a central nervous system. This led to biological arms races and the evolution of ever more complex forms, forms in the authors’ opinion with the potential for ever more sophisticated ways of thinking—memory, imagination, and so forth. The final chapter takes up some implications, refinements, and objections.

In The Divided Brain and the Search for Meaning (priced at just over £1) McGilchrist asks why – despite the vast increase in material well-being – people are less happy today than they were half a century ago, and suggests that the division between the two hemispheres of the brain has a critical effect on how we see and understand the world around us.

In particular, he suggests, the left hemisphere’s obsession with reducing everything it sees to the level of minute, mechanistic detail is robbing modern society of the ability to understand and appreciate deeper human values.

“In the contemporary world, where I fear we are currently in thrall to the left hemisphere’s way of thinking, the problem, that the piece of paper has become more important than the reality that it refers to, is endemic. Surgeons have a saying that is, I sometimes think, only half-facetious: ‘the operation was a success, but the patient died’… Nowadays the operation is scarcely required, as long as the box was ticked. That way success is assured, because ‘that’s what it says on this sheet of paper’… In life we need the contributions of both hemispheres. As Kant memorably put it, concepts without intuitions are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind. We need the contributions of both, but for different purposes. An uncritical following of intuition can lead us astray, but so can an uncritical following of logic.”–Iain McGilchrist

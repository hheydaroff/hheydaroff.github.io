It took [Johanna and me](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/limitatons) a few years to figure out how to be sincere about the flaws we saw in each other. I’m not sure what changed to make it less uncomfortable. Partly it was exposure training, I guess. If you get enough feedback, you figure out that having your failures pointed out doesn’t hurt you. It is just data.





Skills are generally improved by tight feedback loops, and often simply using the skill to achieve your goals is not a very tight feedback loop for the particular aspect of it you are constrained on, because there’s so much else going on that it makes the feedback loop very slow.

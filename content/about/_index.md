# About Me

Hi there, I'm Hido, a Product Manager with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology, psychology, and human behavior. 

## My Background

I hold a degree in Economics and have been working in the automotive industry for over half a decade. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing teams and have been involved in launching several successful products. 

## My Interests

I have a broad range of interests, including:

- **Reading:** I'm an avid reader and enjoy exploring topics related to psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy. Check my [Goodreads Profile](https://www.goodreads.com/hheydaroff).
- **Neuroscience:** I'm fascinated by the workings of the brain and how we can leverage our understanding of it to create better products and services.
- **Philosophy:** I enjoy exploring different philosophical schools of thought and how they can inform our understanding of the world and guide our decision-making.
- **Productivity:** As a Product Manager, I'm always looking for ways to optimize my own productivity and help my team do the same.

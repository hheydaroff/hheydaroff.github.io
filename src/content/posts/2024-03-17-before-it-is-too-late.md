I am not sure how the time works in other realities, parallel universes or the alternative simulations. In our world though time is ticking in one direction, relentlessly marching towards the next cycle of beginnings while ending the existing ones. It is a treasury that you have to pick as it is there, because once it has passed you can never recover it. Sounds crazy, but it is the truth. The phrase "before it is too late" is a call to action, a prompt to awaken to the present and seize the day before the opportunity passes by.

We take our health for granted. Have you ever reflected about and thanked for having your eyes, your ears, your nose, your lungs, your fingers, your senses, your ability to move? That's another reason why we are also not taking much care of our health until those problems decrease our life quality and limits our liberty. We postpone the doctor's appointment, shrug off the daily exercise, or  spoil in unhealthy eating habits.

Before it is too late, listen to the whispers of your body. Do not wait for a scream before you attend to its needs. Regular check-ups, a balanced diet, sufficient rest, and exercise are not just items on a to-do list; they are acts of self-respect. The investment you make in your health today is a gift to your future self, a bridge to a life lived with vitality rather than one marred by preventable ailments.

We also regret for not spending enough time with our beloved ones. Once our parents pass away, that's when it hits hard. We often assume that our loved ones know how much they mean to us. Assumption is the silent thief of opportunity to express affection. Before it is too late, say 'I love you' to your beloved ones. Connecting the 'love' with 'I' and 'you' opens up a new realm of connection and can heal wounds and deepend bonds. 

The philosophy of "before it is too late" goes beyond individual actions; it speaks to a way of life. It's about cultivating mindfulness, recognizing the impermanence of life, and acting with intention. It's a reminder to forgive quickly, to let go of grudges, and to live authentically.

Before it is too late, let us awaken to the present. Let us live deliberately, with compassion for ourselves and others. Let us not defer life, for the future is composed of 'nows' that we must grasp with both hands. Make it count.

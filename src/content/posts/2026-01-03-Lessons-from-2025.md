# Turning Point
I was getting dressed that morning and leave for work in 15 minutes or so. Suddenly my wife came to the room and said 'I guess it is the time'. I forgot everything else. We prepared and left to the hospital. After a long and exhausting day, at 20:20, we welcomed our little boy into this world. It was probably the biggest emotional burst I'd ever felt. Getting him into my arms, feeling the movement of his body, seeing his face wrinkle when crying, holding those little hands. There are some things that are so supernatural that putting them into words constraints their true form. The birth of our son was one of those moments. 

After that day, everything in my life has changed. All the routins, all the priorities, all the plans, all the dreams, all the goals. I do not think anyone becomes prepared for such a revolution. Many things that I'd thought was meaningful has lost their meaning and importance. It was hard to answer what the meaning of my life is, but now that I am looking into his eyes, I do see the meaning. 

> Some life experiences are so profound that it defies articulation. To understand it, you need to feel it. The most important transformations are not the ones you prepare for; they are the ones that prepare you for everything that follows.

# First AI Steps
In September of 2024, I bet on building an in-house AI platform that could power any use case. The vision was to make intelligence the new utility in all our products and processes. At the time, we had no resources, no experience on building AI solutions, no executive support whatsoever. Just a bold vision. We did not even have a dedicated team.

First use case came to us by chance, and we took the opportunity. We were going to build a customer case assistant. AI Agents was still at the early conceptualization and formation phase. We could go that path, but we decided to use a deterministic workflow, which turned out to be very efficient and consistent. 

We went live with the first version end of February 2025. I was on parental leave, but I did not miss the chance to go to office and celebrate the go live with the team.  It was a proud moment. We had done it. A team of four developers built the first AI solution within three months. If you want to know more about our solution, you can read [the dedicated article on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/how-smart-europe-revolutionized-automotive-customer-support-with-amazon-bedrock/). 

> Vision matters. A small, committed team willing to take calculated risks can achieve what seems impossible in short timeframes. Sometimes the pragmatic choice (deterministic workflows) beats the trendy one (early AI Agents), and that is a lesson I see worthy to remember: let the problem guide the solution, not the hype. 


# AI for Everyone
It was not a surprise to us that everybody uses ChatGPT. Gemini or Copilot was not that popular yet at the time, but ChatGPT was everyone's AI companion. I was very happy to see the adoption of AI by everyone. That meant, if we could solve their daily work problems, they'd also easily adopt our AI solutions. So we made us of the open source tools and built an internal AI chat platform with customer agent building and RAG built-in, and people used it. They built their own knowledge bases, their own agents. The feedback already started to flow in. It was slower than ChatGPT they said. That was inspiring. Our open-source tool was slower than ChatGPT, that was the only criticism. I was again sure that we are on the right track. 

After some architectural overhaul, we built few advanced AI Agents. One of the we called Talk-To-Data. It was not the most creative name. As we did not want to deal with marketing, we chose the most explanatory name. What Talk-To-Data agent does is to understand user's inquiry, turn it into data question, create SQL query and execute it on data, retrieve the results and create a report. We solved a basic issue with this agent - access to data. 

Another advanced agent is called Deep Research. It is similar to Gemini Deep Research or ChatGPT Deep Research. The biggest benefit for our users is that we built the workflow in a way that they could upload their internal documents and deep research agent would synthesize both internal and external knowledge to create the final report. With deep research our marketing team could run research on the brand image, create product briefs, and so on. 

Besides user facing AI agents, we also built backend agents that are integrated into the workflows to enrich, summarize, categorize, or generate content. With the help of coding assistants, we also built few frontend tools for certain deterministic workflows. 

> When users are comparing your product to the industry leader (i.e. ChatGPT) and even complain that it is slower than theirs, you're then doing something right. They are comparing you to the gold standard, not questioning the product's relevance. The key to Enterprise AI usccess is not just building powerful AI tools; it is making intelligence accessible enough that everyone becomes a builder.


# From Wild West to Governed AI
The challenge that I cannot ignore is AI proliferation. It is everywhere, sold by everyone, for everything, as a freemium subscription model. AI Chat Platforms either offer registration-less entry, sometimes even  installed on default at the most visible spots of your software and hardware. SaaS offering AI services as part of your workflow for free and automatically enabled, consulting companies offering AI implementations as part of their services, vendors offering AI tools for free that would optimize the costs, and so on. As the entry is without barrier, you can simply jump onto it. 

The problem is that it is being applied ubiquitously, often without proper governance or clear business justification. To prevent any unintended impact, we proposed and established an AI use case governance framework, which is being used as guidance. Whenever anyone has an AI related use case request, or a solution proposal, it moves through a one-stop shop evaluation. The evaluation is done by a cross-functional team, which includes AI experts, data protection and compliance colelagues, and business team. The evaluation is done in a structured way, and if it passes, then the use case or solution proposal can be implemented. If not, then we would find the problem it is trying to solve and try to identify alternative solutions.

> Democratization without governance is a chaos waiting to happen, especially in AI where the barriers to entry are nearly zero. The challenge is not preventing innovation but channeling it through structured evaluation that balances opportunity with responsbility. 

# Trust the Process and Grind
It was for the first time in my life where my nights were truly disturbed. Every single night. Not just once, but constantly, at any moment. Having a baby makes day and night unpredictable, a blur without rest. But I survived, like very other parent out there.

There was no time to breathe. This complex ecosystem of work and family life made it impossible to take a break. Besides caring for our newborn, I had to run after our AI vision despite all the blockers and with virtually no support. It felt like we were a startup desperately trying to find success, fighting for survival on two fronts simultaneously.

Then, at the end of the year, we found the funding. The validation arrived. We believed in the vision. We trusted the process. Resilience through the grind became our path to success.

> Some periods of life demand we fight on multiple fronts simultaneously, with no time to process either battle. Resilience is not about having the strength to push through. It is about maintaining belief in your vision when validation feels impossibly distant. Success may come easily to some, and the path may be brutally hard for you, but those who refuse to quit will get there. That is the guarantee persistence offers.

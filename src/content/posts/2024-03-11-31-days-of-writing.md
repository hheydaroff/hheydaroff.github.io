I had written 31 articles (including this one) in last 31 days. When I said I am [getting back to writing]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-10-back-to-writing">}}), I thought I was ambitious with daily writing,and I was. Here are my reflections overall.

I wrote on average between 250-600 words per article. While writing an article, I used to have a proper structure built around it. It had taken few hours until I could've come up with a single outlay. That was before. Since I started writing on a daily basis, planning or editing did not take a priority in the process. I am pretty sure I have many grammar mistakes or typos in the posts shared. I purposefully did not care about it. Otherwise I would have slept over it, which I actually had done few times.

Another expectation I had 31 days ago was that I'd only be able to write at the evening, around 11pm. It's actually almost 11pm while I am writing this sentence, and most of the articles were written around this time. It makes sense, this is the only time I have tranquility during the day with no other concern in mind. What follows the sharing of post is reading for half an hour and falling asleep. 

Regarding the content, I don't think there is really a narrow pattern of scope. It started with reflecting upon the [work]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-12-ego-driven-optimization">}}) [related]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-13-reflecting-on-managing.md">}}) [topics]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-15-dealing-with-toxic-stakeholders">}}) and [discussions]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-17-fostering-workplace-camaraderie">}}), and on [daily]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-14-questioning-if-it-makes-sense">}}) [stuff]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-16-where-to-be">}}) I [question]({{<ref "/posts/2024-02-18-dead-sunday">}}) regularly, and added some productivity methods and tools, and some rephrasing what I have read somewhere else in order to test my comprehension of text I've read. 

Writing is a way of expressing my thoughts in a more complete way than in wordly snapshots. It helps me to clarify, structure and actually write the thoughts down. In my work, personal and virtual life, writing is a vital skill to improve anyways, so I do have fun doing it.

As a last thing, I have to admit that I got the help of LLM (ChatGPT, Poe.com, Perplexity) to structure my bullet points in a more readable way, and even used some text generation which I reused only some parts of it. You can submit the articles to AI Plagiarism Checker if you want. Nonetheless, I actually like writing myself than letting AI do it. I will still continue using the tools for getting a structure for the outlay, specific content style and so on. 

I am continuing the journey of daily writing. Let's see if I can do a strike of another 30 days.

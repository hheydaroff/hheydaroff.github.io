<p>Leadership sets the benchmark for the culture of communication within an organization. Encouraging open dialogue, showing appreciation for diverse viewpoints, and experimenting flexibility in communication styles can turn the &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand&rdquo; impasse into a collaborative effort to truly understand each other.</p>

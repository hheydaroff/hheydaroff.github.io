      <p>I have not written a blog post since long time. Actually the <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/transparency-and-candor-empowering-employees-with-confidence-and-trust/">previous post</a> was written on 22.06.2023. That does not mean I have not written anything though. In the meantime, I have published few posts on Linkedin, mostly on the communication of my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heyhido_app-activity-7150062233580965888-Pken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekend</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heyhido_github-hheydaroffdostgpt-this-is-a-repo-activity-7116387953202864128-iUTy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hustles</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heyhido_to-finish-the-year-with-a-gift-to-activity-7142168222023262208-NN9Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certificate</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heyhido_im-happy-to-share-that-ive-finished-activity-7112813835270426624-_Krj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achievements</a>, and sometimes commenting on the posts I have read online.</p>
<p>I also have written quite a lot at my work as a Product Manager. Meeting summaries, incident analyses, rollout posts, PRDs, monthly updates, and many more types of different contents, written for different types of personas. But I feel like I&rsquo;m not writing much. To make it more explicit, I realised I am not writing often. I just do big-chunk-writings irregularly.</p>
<p>To change this habit, I have decided to start writing as often as possible. I will try to write at least once a day as part of my <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/self-reflection-for-a-satisfying-life/">journalling activity</a>. To be honest, even the writing a journal had not been a regularly thing since quite a while. As mentioned, I had stopped writing. Now is time to bring it back. I do not know though if I will be able to publish as often as once a day. I am publishing to my blog through my github repo. It means I need to write, commit, push via git using a laptop. My laptop might not always be with me, which may result in an irregularity of posting. I will try to find a solution to that as soon as I will face it.</p>
<p>Within this process, I know that there will be a lot of uninteresting pieces of text I will publish. I will use this blog as my main platform to publish the posts, but I might occasionally post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heyhido/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linkedin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/heyhido" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> as well.</p>
<p>My choice of writing tool is usually <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notion</a>. I try to use the <a href="https://leananki.com/zettelkasten-method-smart-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zettelkasten method</a> to store and organize my notes, which I eventually also use as ideas for writing. I am experimenting occasinally other means of recording thoughts and ideas, planning and writing a text (i.e. Obsidian). Notion still is the default tool of mine though. The reason I use it more often is because it can be synced across all my devices and beyond real time. That makes writing easier everywhere, all the time. I used to read my books on <a href="https://www.scribd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scribd</a> (before it turned into <a href="https://www.everand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everand</a>) also for this reason.</p>
<p>I wrote this post at 11pm. I don&rsquo;t know if I will be writing at the same time tomorrow or not. I have not decided that yet, just because the dynamics of the days can change easily. I will try to observe for a while and optimize for a shorter range of &ldquo;time of publishing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get it rolling.</p>

      <p>Unknowns open up a new potential of growth. When we face what we had not seen before, we come up with more creative ideas to uncover the reality. There is a highly likelihood of failing exposing it, but what&rsquo;s the fun if not the process of digging up the truth.</p>
<p>In 2017, a small object called &lsquo;Oumuamua entered into our solar system, traveled through the inner part of it and left even faster. It was the first confirmed object that have come from an outside planetary system. It has a weird shape. With long and thin-cigar-like-shape &lsquo;Oumuamua accelerated as if something were pushing onto it. By the time we realized its existence, the guest was already out the door with its image fading into the dark street, so we did not have a chance to get a second look at its mysterious qualities.</p>
<p>Scientists do not have any certain ideas on what &lsquo;Oumuamua is about. We know it is not from around here. It is tumbling, namely rotating on more than one axis. We know that it had been accelerating, and that&rsquo;s where the amusing things happen. A normal comet would&rsquo;ve had a cometary tail due to evaporation of material. However, the &lsquo;Oumuamua did not have it. There was no &lsquo;coma&rsquo; or outgassing detected coming from the object. Normally, comets come from regions more distant from the sun than asteroids, and ice on their surface turns straight into gas as they approach the sun, leaving behind a trail of gas, or what we see as a beautiful comet tail. With all the information that was gathered, still the identity of &lsquo;Oumuamua is not discovered.</p>

      <p>Objectives provide the teams with a target to move towards. Core values provide them with the shared understanding of how to work together to reach the target. A set of values act like a guidance. It should be present in every interaction.</p>
<p>Strong team values help to avoid conflicts, identify way of working, achieve desired results, create sense of inclusion, and have a <a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/transparency-and-candor-empowering-employees-with-confidence-and-trust/">pyshcological safety</a> at work.  For instance, if the team is valuing the customer pleasure, they will prioritize their work to increase value towards customers. Few examples of core values are the following: curiosity, empathy, customer-centricity, integrity, trust, respect, passion, developing, teamwork, and so on.</p>
<p>In order to come up with a reasonable and legit set of core values, the team needs to provide input based on their experience and expectations so far. Once all input from employees are collected, the categorization &amp; voting should narrow the options down to 3-5. Why 3-5? To be very honest, I just assume that the memorability of more than 5 words is quite unlikely. Once the list is finalized, it is also quite important to describe those values and provide example actions for &ldquo;how&rdquo; to live those core values.</p>
<p>Lastly, the journey only starts after defining the core values. It is not enough only to stick the core values on a wall or store it in a random Confluence page. It is important to adhere to them and promote them. <a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/transparency-and-candor-empowering-employees-with-confidence-and-trust/">Leadership should adopt</a> and inspire the others to embrace the core values. The employees who are creating good examplary deliverables that reflect the values should be recognized and rewarded.</p>

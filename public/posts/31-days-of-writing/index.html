    <div class="content">
      <p>I had written 31 articles (including this one) in last 31 days. When I said I am <a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/back-to-writing-hopefully-this-time-more-often/">getting back to writing</a>, I thought I was ambitious with daily writing,and I was. Here are my reflections overall.</p>
<p>I wrote on average between 250-600 words per article. While writing an article, I used to have a proper structure built around it. It had taken few hours until I could&rsquo;ve come up with a single outlay. That was before. Since I started writing on a daily basis, planning or editing did not take a priority in the process. I am pretty sure I have many grammar mistakes or typos in the posts shared. I purposefully did not care about it. Otherwise I would have slept over it, which I actually had done few times.</p>
<p>Another expectation I had 31 days ago was that I&rsquo;d only be able to write at the evening, around 11pm. It&rsquo;s actually almost 11pm while I am writing this sentence, and most of the articles were written around this time. It makes sense, this is the only time I have tranquility during the day with no other concern in mind. What follows the sharing of post is reading for half an hour and falling asleep.</p>
<p>Regarding the content, I don&rsquo;t think there is really a narrow pattern of scope. It started with reflecting upon the <a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/ego-driven-optimization/">work</a> <a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/reflecting-on-managing/">related</a> <a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/dealing-with-toxic-stakeholders/">topics</a> and <a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/fostering-workplace-camaraderie/">discussions</a>, and on <a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/questioning-if-it-makes-sense/">daily</a> <a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/where-to-be/">stuff</a> I <a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/dead-sunday/">question</a> regularly, and added some productivity methods and tools, and some rephrasing what I have read somewhere else in order to test my comprehension of text I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>Writing is a way of expressing my thoughts in a more complete way than in wordly snapshots. It helps me to clarify, structure and actually write the thoughts down. In my work, personal and virtual life, writing is a vital skill to improve anyways, so I do have fun doing it.</p>
<p>As a last thing, I have to admit that I got the help of LLM (ChatGPT, Poe.com, Perplexity) to structure my bullet points in a more readable way, and even used some text generation which I reused only some parts of it. You can submit the articles to AI Plagiarism Checker if you want. Nonetheless, I actually like writing myself than letting AI do it. I will still continue using the tools for getting a structure for the outlay, specific content style and so on.</p>
<p>I am continuing the journey of daily writing. Let&rsquo;s see if I can do a strike of another 30 days.</p>

The Idea: Walk Your Calories üîóMy project stemmed from a common dilemma: the guilt that follows indulging in a slice (or three) of Bufalina pizza (of L&rsquo;Artista in Stuttgart). I often found myself wondering, &ldquo;How much walking would it take to burn off these calories?&rdquo; This curiosity led me to create walkyourcalories.com, an online calculator that determines how many steps you need to take to burn off a specific number of calories, based on your weight and walking pace.">

      <p>Few days ago, I embarked on an exciting journey to develop my first web application from scratch, leveraging the power of AI coding assistants. The experience was enlightening, and I&rsquo;d like to share my insights on the role of AI in software development, particularly for those considering similar projects.</p>
<h2 id="the-idea-walk-your-calories">The Idea: Walk Your Calories <a href="#the-idea-walk-your-calories" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>My project stemmed from a common dilemma: the guilt that follows indulging in a slice (or three) of Bufalina pizza (of <a href="https://www.lartista-pizza.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L&rsquo;Artista in Stuttgart</a>). I often found myself wondering, &ldquo;How much walking would it take to burn off these calories?&rdquo; This curiosity led me to create <a href="https://walkyourcalories.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walkyourcalories.com</a>, an online calculator that determines how many steps you need to take to burn off a specific number of calories, based on your weight and walking pace.</p>
<h2 id="the-tech-stack-and-ai-assistant">The Tech Stack and AI Assistant <a href="#the-tech-stack-and-ai-assistant" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>For this project, I chose a Python Flask backend with HTML and CSS for the frontend. To assist with the coding process, I used <a href="https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roo-Code</a>, an open-source fork of <a href="https://github.com/cline/cline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cline</a> that allows integration with various LLMs. I opted for Claude Sonnet 3.5 as my AI model.</p>
<h2 id="the-reality-of-ai-assisted-development">The Reality of AI-Assisted Development <a href="#the-reality-of-ai-assisted-development" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>While AI coding assistants are powerful tools, my experience highlighted that they&rsquo;re not yet a complete replacement for traditional software development skills. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>UI Design Limitations</strong>: AI tends to generate typical, generic user interfaces. To create a unique and appealing design, I still needed to research layouts, components, and UI elements independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment Challenges</strong>: The AI assistant could generate code that ran on <code>localhost:5000</code>, but deploying the application to the internet required additional knowledge. Understanding hosting, domain configuration, and server setup was crucial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Considerations</strong>: Implementing HTTPS for secure connections involved learning about nginx, certbot, and Let&rsquo;s Encrypt ‚Äì topics that required research beyond what the AI could provide.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-learning-curve">The Learning Curve <a href="#the-learning-curve" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Despite using an AI assistant, I faced several challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>Customizing the UI beyond generic templates</li>
<li>Configuring a server to host the application (I used Hetzner with Docker)</li>
<li>Setting up a domain and ensuring secure HTTPS connections</li>
</ol>
<p>These hurdles underscored the importance of understanding fundamental web development concepts, even when using AI tools.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-ai-in-development">The Future of AI in Development <a href="#the-future-of-ai-in-development" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>While AI coding assistants are incredibly helpful, they&rsquo;re not yet a complete solution for product development and launch. Unless one opts for &ldquo;managed service&rdquo; AI product development platforms (like <a href="https://lovable.dev/?gad_source=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lovable</a>, <a href="https://v0.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel v0</a>, or <a href="https://bolt.new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt</a>), a solid understanding of software development principles remains essential.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Creating <a href="https://walkyourcalories.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walkyourcalories.com</a> was my first experience developing a web application from scratch and bringing it to life. The process taught me that while AI can significantly accelerate development, it doesn&rsquo;t replace the need for fundamental knowledge in web technologies, deployment strategies, and security practices.</p>
<p>As I look forward to working on more ideas, I&rsquo;m excited about the potential of AI-assisted development. However, I&rsquo;m also clearly aware of the importance of continually expanding technical skills to make the most of these powerful tools as assistants, rather than fully independent agents.</p>

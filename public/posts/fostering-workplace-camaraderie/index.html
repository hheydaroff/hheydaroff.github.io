      <p>Socializing is part of human nature, historically. In an earlier post I have talked about <a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/reflecting-on-the-why-of-working/">the &lsquo;why&rsquo; of working</a>. The evolution of work can be divided into three stages: Work, Job, and Career. Initially, as humans transitioned from nomadic hunter-gatherers to agrarian societies, collective tasks and labor hierarchies emerged, transforming the nature of work. In recent centuries, the concept of a &lsquo;job&rsquo; developed, characterized by the professional image and the need for basic qualifications to operate machinery. The most recent phase, the &lsquo;career,&rsquo; reflects a shift where people work not just for money but for professional growth, making it harder for organizations to retain employees.</p>
<p>With globalization, startups, technological advancements, and events like COVID, the nature of work is rapidly changing. Organizations are now evaluated based on several desirability factors.</p>
<p>Socializing at the workplace is a multifaceted concept that encompasses the interactions and relationships between employees outside of their professional tasks. It&rsquo;s an aspect of work life that has gained increasing attention for its potential to enhance both individual well-being and organizational performance.</p>
<p>Socializing with your colleagues positively impacts your perception of the workplace, your sense of contentment, and your career. it helps build a sense of belonging as a community. When employees feel the vibe of connection with their colleagues, they are more likely to enjoy their work, feel committed to the organization, and show better engagement and productivity.</p>
<p>Morevoer, social interactions at work can lead to the exchange of ideas and knowledge, fostering innovation and creativity. When employees socialize, they share more than just personal stories; they exchange professional knowledge and skills. This informal learning can lead to personal and professional growth. It&rsquo;s all essential for mental health and job satisfaction engagement and productivity.</p>
<p><a href="https://heyhido.com/posts/keeping-sanity-with-home-office-in-covid-times/">Remote work</a> quickly halted many of our normal social activities at work for a while. We were not able to have a physical presence at the office, and no interaction possibility with colleagues. No coffee breaks, no water cooler chats, no tap-the-shoulder-i-have-a-question conversation. All of them got eliminated from the workday. Nowadays the situation changes a bit and returning back to the office gains some traction. I&rsquo;d argue that, regardless remote or onsite, the social interaction is still possible to manage and should be promoted for both types of workplaces.</p>
<p>Leaders and managers are key in fostering a social atmosphere at work. Leadership should actively participate in social activities and demonstrate the value of socializing. When employees see their managers and supervisors engaging with others, they are more likely to do the same. They can set up team activities, fun gatherings, and cozy hangout spots for casual chats among staff. Promoting a work environment that appreciates and recognizes collaborative efforts can inspire workers to connect more with their peers. However, it&rsquo;s crucial to balance social time with work tasks. Socializing should boost happiness and teamwork without getting in the way of the job at hand. Clear rules and limits can help make sure that mingling at work is beneficial and doesn&rsquo;t interfere with professional goals.</p>
<p>As a bonus, here are few etiqquets in the art of socializing with coworkers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be friendly and polite, but do not overdo the friendliness in an appropriate way.</li>
<li>Listen, pay attention and respond appropriately.</li>
<li>Give sincere and honest compliments.</li>
<li>Show some positive mannerisms. Saying hello, wishing good luck or a good day and smiling are basics of socializing.</li>
<li>Genuine interest is very important. Do not take part in events if you are not interested in them.</li>
<li>Respect and be tolerant of different opinions.</li>
<li>Be open and inclusive. This means engaging with a diverse range of colleagues and ensuring that social activities are accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or position within the company.</li>
</ul>

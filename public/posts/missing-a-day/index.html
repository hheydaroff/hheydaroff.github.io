What has worked for me in the last 12 days was that I have a fixed time of the day to write. ~11pm is my writing before going to bed time. It&rsquo;s a good time, because there is usually now work left to do. I am almost always at home around that time. It&rsquo;s my reading and writing time in general. I also do my reflection of the day during that time. So, I can integrate writing easily into that routine.">

      <p>Being [back to writing]http://localhost:1313/posts/back-to-writing-hopefully-this-time-more-often/ on a daily basis, the first failure milestone was achieved yesterday. I forgot to write. I completely have forgotten it. Until today 11pm. Why?!</p>
<p>What has worked for me in the last 12 days was that I have a fixed time of the day to write. ~11pm is my writing before going to bed time. It&rsquo;s a good time, because there is usually now work left to do. I am almost always at home around that time. It&rsquo;s my reading and writing time in general. I also do my <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/self-reflection-for-a-satisfying-life/">reflection</a> of the day during that time. So, I can <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/daily-doses-of-new-deeds/">integrate</a> writing easily into that routine.</p>
<p>But yesterday it didn&rsquo;t work out as expected. Technically I was still writing a text. It was in a different context and not relevant for the blog. But since I was writing somethign, my brain accepted that the element of routine is successfully completed for the day. It didn&rsquo;t alert itself that the writing I did was for another purpose and I still had to finish the daily post as well.</p>
<p>It is fine though. Like with everything else, there is always a possibility of missing the routine for certain amount of times. One day of not writing is not the disastrous problem. I added <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/conways-law-on-data/">another article</a> today on top of this one to cover the missing piece of yesterday. It should not be happening a lot though and the missing days should be covered asap.</p>

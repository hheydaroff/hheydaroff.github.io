Courage is an ability. Ability is having the skill or a proficiency to do something. In this case, courage is not an inherent trait, but rather a skill to learn. As with every skill, it is something one can grow by learning and practicing it.">

      <p>According to <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/courage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Cambridge Dictionary</a>, courage is the ability to control your fear in a dangerous or difficult situation. Let&rsquo;s analyse this definition word-by-word to see what courage is about.</p>
<p>Courage is <strong>an ability</strong>. Ability is having the skill or a proficiency to do something. In this case, courage is not an inherent trait, but rather a skill to learn. As with every skill, it is something one can grow by learning and practicing it.</p>
<p>It helps to <strong>control your fear</strong>. The skill you grow, exercising restraint or direction over, is for managing your psychological stand, such as the feeling of fear. Courage is maintaining the reaction towards situations that trigger fear. Fear is a natural response to danger but can be paralyzing if not managed.</p>
<p>You need to control your fear against <strong>dangerous or difficult situations</strong>. In the case of danger, it involves possible injury, harm, or loss. Whereas the difficult situation is about putting an effort or skill to accomplish, deal with, or understand. Difficult or dangerous situations test our courage by presenting challenges that are not easily overcome and are threatening.</p>
<p>Putting it all together, courage is a skill that empowers an individual to manage their instinctual response of fear when faced with real and significant risks or challenges. It&rsquo;s not just the absence of fear, but the considered and intentional action taken in spite of it.</p>

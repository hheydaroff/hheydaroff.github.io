      <p>It was another day of <a href="https://heydaroff.info/2021/01/04/how-self-reflection-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflection</a> Friday. I was looking at my annual, and quarterly targets and checking if my week was contributing to them. It has not yet been a routine for me, but <a href="https://heydaroff.info/2021/02/04/bullet-proof-productivity-with-okrs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I try to do it every Friday</a> (Tip: putting recurrent Friday blockers on a calendar helps to remind myself).</p>
<p>One of the goals I achieved in 2022 was <a href="https://heydaroff.info/2022/12/29/finding-joy-in-the-pages-my-top-5-books-of-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading 20 books</a>. Reading helps to keep my mental health fit and learn more about the world and the people in it. <a href="https://heydaroff.info/2021/07/04/prosoche-reflecting-on-attention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">While reviewing this goal I realized something</a> does not look correct. I had read those books, but I do not remember all of them. It hit me there that reading many books does not make sense if I do not remember what I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>This thought opened up a new space for <a href="https://heydaroff.info/2021/04/05/reflecting-on-making-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questioning my activities</a>. Another under-productive thing I&rsquo;ve been doing was trying to have 5-7 tasks completed each day. Having a lot to do each day did not mean I was doing important stuff. It was just an easy and misleading self-satisfaction habit.</p>
<h3 id="setting-goals">Setting Goals <a href="#setting-goals" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In general, setting goals is important because it helps us define what we want to achieve, create a roadmap for how to get there, and provide a sense of purpose and direction in our lives. Without clear goals, we may lack motivation, feel aimless or unsure of our direction, and struggle to prioritize tasks effectively.</p>
<p>There are several techniques and frameworks for setting goals effectively. One commonly used framework is the¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMART framework</a>, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This framework helps ensure that goals are well-defined, achievable, and have a clear deadline. Another technique is to set process-oriented goals rather than outcome-oriented goals. Process-oriented goals focus on the actions and behaviors needed to achieve a desired outcome, rather than the outcome itself. This can help individuals stay motivated and avoid getting discouraged by setbacks or obstacles.</p>
<h3 id="pareto-optimization">Pareto Optimization <a href="#pareto-optimization" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>When setting goals, it‚Äôs important to do it according to¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pareto optimization</a>¬†(a.k.a. Multi-objective optimization) because it helps to maximize productivity while considering multiple objectives or constraints. This approach allows us to prioritize and optimize our efforts based on the most important factors or objectives.</p>
<p>For example, when setting a goal to read my mental health, a Pareto optimization approach might involve identifying and prioritizing multiple factors, such as information retention, time constraints, stress reduction, and sleep. By considering all of these factors and their impact on health, I can create a plan that maximizes my overall mental health and learning objectives.</p>
<p>In contrast, setting a single goal without considering other factors or constraints can lead to suboptimal results. For instance, focusing solely on reading as many books as possible will just make it useless since I will try to read either smaller books or read faster which brings subprime outcomes.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs have a look at a few more examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Weight loss: Focusing solely on losing weight without taking into account nutrition and exercise can lead to sub-optimal outcomes. For example, someone who tries to lose weight by severely restricting calories may end up losing muscle mass instead of fat, which can make it harder to maintain a healthy weight in the long run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career advancement: Concentrating only on climbing the corporate ladder without taking into account work-life balance and job satisfaction can lead to burnout and dissatisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial goals: Focusing only on maximizing profits without considering ethical or environmental concerns can be sub-optimal in the long run. For example, a company that prioritizes profits over environmental sustainability may eventually face negative consequences such as damage to its reputation, legal fines, or loss of customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal relationships: Being egocentric on one&rsquo;s own needs and desires without considering the needs and desires of others may end up causing harm and ultimately damaging the relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Academic achievement: If a student sets a goal of getting straight A&rsquo;s without considering factors such as time management, self-care, and social support, they may engage in unhealthy behaviors such as pulling all-nighters or neglecting their mental health, which can lead to burnout and poor academic performance in the remote future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business growth: If a business sets a goal of maximizing profits without considering factors such as customer satisfaction, employee engagement, and social responsibility, it may engage in practices that harm its reputation and lead to long-term financial losses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lets-put-it-all-together">Let‚Äôs put it all together <a href="#lets-put-it-all-together" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Goal setting is an important process for defining what we want to achieve, creating a roadmap for how to get there, and providing a sense of purpose and direction in our lives. However, it&rsquo;s crucial to set goals effectively by considering multiple objectives or constraints, which is where Pareto optimization comes in.</p>
<p>Pareto optimization, also known as multi-objective optimization, helps maximize productivity while taking into account multiple factors, such as information retention, time constraints, stress reduction, and sleep. By applying a Pareto optimization approach to productivity and goal setting, we can identify and address multiple objectives or constraints, leading to more effective and efficient goal setting and achievement.</p>
<p>Focusing solely on a single goal without considering other factors or constraints can lead to suboptimal results. For example, trying to lose weight by severely restricting calories may lead to muscle loss instead of fat loss, and prioritizing profits over environmental sustainability may lead to long-term financial losses.</p>
<p>To set effective goals, we can use frameworks like the SMART framework, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. We can also set process-oriented goals that focus on the actions and behaviors needed to achieve a desired outcome, rather than the outcome itself.</p>
<p>Ultimately, by applying a Pareto optimization approach to goal setting, we can identify and address multiple objectives or constraints, leading to more effective and efficient goal achievement.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few days ago, I embarked on an exciting journey to develop my first web application from scratch, leveraging the power of AI coding assistants. The experience was enlightening, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my insights on the role of AI in software development, particularly for those considering similar projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-idea-walk-your-calories&#34;&gt;The Idea: Walk Your Calories &lt;a href=&#34;#the-idea-walk-your-calories&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My project stemmed from a common dilemma: the guilt that follows indulging in a slice (or three) of Bufalina pizza (of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lartista-pizza.de&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;L&amp;rsquo;Artista in Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt;). I often found myself wondering, &amp;ldquo;How much walking would it take to burn off these calories?&amp;rdquo; This curiosity led me to create &lt;a href=&#34;https://walkyourcalories.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;walkyourcalories.com&lt;/a&gt;, an online calculator that determines how many steps you need to take to burn off a specific number of calories, based on your weight and walking pace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is amazing how open source community is creating amazing artifacts. HuggingFaceü§ó recently shared a deep wisdom about how Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained. As you know, LLMs are reshaping industries, but training them demands immense computing power. I read the article, and here I try to distills key insights from &lt;a href=&#34;https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Ultra-Scale Playbook: Training LLMs on GPU Clusters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, offering a simple perspective on scaling LLM training across vast GPU infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how those super-smart AI systems like ChatGPT are made? Well, buckle up because we&amp;rsquo;re about to dive into the world of DeepSeek-R1 and other advanced AI models that are taking reasoning capabilities to the next level. Think of it as upgrading the brain of your computer!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-deepseek-r1-and-similar-models&#34;&gt;What are DeepSeek-R1 and Similar Models? &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-deepseek-r1-and-similar-models&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek-R1 is a new AI model designed to be exceptionally good at reasoning. That means it can solve problems, understand complex topics, and even write code with a higher level of intelligence than some of the models we&amp;rsquo;ve seen before. DeepSeek-R1 is built upon and enhances the DeepSeek v3 base model, which has 671 billion parameters. But DeepSeek-R1 isn&amp;rsquo;t alone in this AI reasoning revolution. OpenAI has also introduced models like o1 and o3, which use similar approaches to enhance their thinking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?: Exploring the Essence of Humanity in a Technological World</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity. At some time, every creature which lives must do so. It is the ultimate shadow, the defeat of creation; this is the curse at work, the curse that feeds on all life. Everywhere in the universe.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I finished reading Philip K. Dick&amp;rsquo;s seminal science fiction novel &amp;ldquo;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&amp;rdquo;, and since then, a profound question has been occupying my mind: What truly separates humans from machines? This thought-provoking work challenges readers to question the nature of consciousness, empathy, and what it means to be human in a world dominated by advanced technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why AI Needs Boundaries Just Like Interns?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine for a moment that you&amp;rsquo;ve just hired a bright-eyed intern for your tech company. They&amp;rsquo;re eager, full of potential, and ready to learn. Now, picture yourself handing them the keys to your entire production database on their first day, with the power to delete everything with a single click. Sounds absurd, right? Yet, in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, we&amp;rsquo;re often tempted to grant similarly unchecked authority to AI systems in critical operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The democratization of innovation is upon us. AI has emerged as a global equalizer, leveling the playing field for entrepreneurs worldwide. As Fei-Fei Li, Co-Director of Stanford&amp;rsquo;s Human-Centered AI Institute, puts it: &amp;ldquo;AI is not just for big tech companies anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s a transformative technology that can empower entrepreneurs everywhere to solve problems and create value in ways we&amp;rsquo;ve never seen before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-breaking-down-barriers-to-entry&#34;&gt;II. Breaking Down Barriers to Entry &lt;a href=&#34;#ii-breaking-down-barriers-to-entry&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-reduced-costs-for-launching-startups&#34;&gt;A. Reduced costs for launching startups &lt;a href=&#34;#a-reduced-costs-for-launching-startups&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days when launching a startup required substantial capital investment. AI-powered tools have dramatically reduced the costs associated with starting a business. From automated customer service chatbots to AI-driven market research tools, entrepreneurs can now access sophisticated capabilities at a fraction of the traditional cost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;a href=&#34;https://heyhido.com/posts/my-wild-ride-with-ai-in-2024-a-slightly-frazzled-reflection/&#34;&gt;when I said&lt;/a&gt; an AI might be deploying this blog while I sip Augustiner Helles on a virtual beach? Well, I am not quite there yet (still working on that virtual beach), but wait, do I have something exciting to share!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to the Feynman Technique AI Learning Buddy ‚Äì the superhero of the learning world that does not wear a cape (though I&amp;rsquo;m working on that feature). This AI brainiac is like having Einstein, Mr. Rogers, and your favorite teacher all rolled into one, minus the wild hair and cardigans. And trust me, it&amp;rsquo;s cooler than finding out your favorite coffee shop now offers unlimited refills and free Wi-Fi. (Productivity levels: skyrocketing!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Remote working will more likely stay in long term. If not hundred percent, it will definitely push many companies to adopt hybrid model. With the COVID hit, tens of millions of people had to move their workplaces to their living places, to their homes. In multiple studies (mostly by management consulting companies) it is estimated that more than 20 to 25 percent of the workforce could work three to five days a week remotely.</description>

      <description>The title of this blog may look like a click-bait, nevertheless it is indeed about the sex in our brains. Gender versus sex discussions have been in philosophy, psychology, sociology and recently in cognitive neuroscience an interesting topic. The topic has many fundamental traits that are way beyond my understanding maturity, thus this article gets more into biological and cognitive research on sex differences.
Gender, a socially constructed role, is a combination of roles, behaviors, expressions, identities we assign to girls, boys, men, women and other diverse groups.</description>

      <title>ProsochÄ“ - Reflecting on attention</title>

      <description>I have to admit that it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult for me to put my attention onto one thing and keep it there for long time. I am getting distracted very easily from the incoming e-mail, a call, the feeling of hunger, the beeping sound of the Whatsapp and so many other stuff. While trying to formulate my thoughts into reasonable structure I shortly went on Clubhouse to listen to some friends and it took me twenty minutes to get back to the activity of writing this blog post.</description>

      <description>Couple of days ago I saw two videos (1, 2) that made me go through the topic of living a happy life again. Actually, not really a happy life but rather a meaningful life (eudaimonia), because the happiness is somehow attached to pleasure (hedonia) and can be a misleading word if not used within the specific context. I should admit that it is not very easy to pinpoint specific checklist or features of a meaningful life, but stoics have defined a meaningful life as:</description>

      <description>With the vaccination process slightly boosting, some advanced economies are opening up slowly. City centers begin to get crowded, eating at restaurants sounds exciting and social life blossoms again. Some of us are even scared that people create the risk of a new wave with their careless attitude.
It was definitely a difficult year and full of uncertainty for everyone and still is. The quarantine period fed us with various stressors that made the process of social distancing even more unbearable.</description>

      <description>Since the start of the COVID lock-down, we&amp;rsquo;ve realized the importance of social interaction even more. Given all the talking and listening, we usually think that we are good listeners. In reality, most of us are very bad at listening, remembering only 25-50 percent of what our hearing senses transmit. Just to make the point clear, at most, on average, only the half of what people tell us we listen to and perceive, the rest we just hear.</description>

      <description>Our body constructor, DNA, can break down every time there is a copying activity of a cell. As DNA carries our genes and provides guideline to proteins on how to build a human being, the rules it transmits are important to be correct. If the letters of the gene get mistaken, deleted, duplicated or mutated in other ways, they can be misunderstood by the proteins and incorrect outcomes may appear. For us, humans, it means getting a cancer, growing Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s or Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s, and many other diseases.</description>

      <title>How does learning help for longer and healthier life?</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s so weird how ignorant we are about aging or living longer. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time I was questioning how I can support my body and mind to live a bit longer and in better health, or even understanding how aging works never occurred to me. Contrary to it, I always conceded that we are mortal and we mostly do not have an influence on the speed of aging.</description>

      <title>What does our brain tell us about habits?</title>
      <link>https://heyhido.com/posts/what-does-our-brain-tell-us-about-habits/</link>

      <guid>https://heyhido.com/posts/what-does-our-brain-tell-us-about-habits/</guid>
      <description>Big part of our life is, without us consciously thinking about it, occupied with habitual processes, such as eating 3 meals a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner&amp;hellip; all at specific hours of day), sleeping (due to our circardian rythym), working (9am-5pm), and so on. We do not question these habits, neither do we have difficulty in remembering to do them, nor do we feel like not doing them. It is sort of automatic and instinctive.</description>

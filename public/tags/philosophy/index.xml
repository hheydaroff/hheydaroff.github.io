      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flappy Bird is a mobile game that was developed by Vietnamese video game artist and developer &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dongatory&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dong Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;. The player must tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and fly up, navigating through a series of pipes that appear on the screen. The goal is to fly as far as possible without hitting any pipes or the ground. Each time the bird successfully passes through a pipe, the player&amp;rsquo;s score increases. The game has simple graphics and players know it for its high level of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What will A.I. do to us?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent developments in A.I. have been extraordinary. Starting in mid of 20th century, A.I. lived through couple of winters and had not given up. Thanks also to the development of the hardware, early 1990s the exponential growth had begun and moving on in unprecedented speed. OpenAIs &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GPT3&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dall-E&lt;/a&gt; in natural language processing (NLP), Deepmind&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AlphaFold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MuZero&lt;/a&gt; (successor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AlphaGo&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AlphaZero&lt;/a&gt;) in Reinforcement Learning, Tesla&amp;rsquo;s Self-Driving &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Autopilot&lt;/a&gt; in Deep Learning are the developments of only the last few years. The field is indeed growing very fast, however it is yet not the level jump we are expecting for, moving from narrow specific problem solving A.I. to general self-aware A.I. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AGI&lt;/a&gt;). There are many more, although not generally accepted, characteristics that we assign to AGI to evaluate it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Prosochē - Reflecting on attention</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult for me to put my attention onto one thing and keep it there for long time. I am getting distracted very easily from the incoming e-mail, a call, the feeling of hunger, the beeping sound of the Whatsapp and so many other stuff. While trying to formulate my thoughts into reasonable structure I shortly went on Clubhouse to listen to some friends and it took me twenty minutes to get back to the activity of writing this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are busy living our lives. You know, the life that has a typical pattern of being born, school, fun, career, family, and death. We&amp;rsquo;re so constantly distracted that we do not have time to &lt;a href=&#34;https://heydaroff.info/2021/01/04/how-self-reflection-leads/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;communicate with ourselves&lt;/a&gt;. Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://heydaroff.info/2021/05/19/mindful-listening-why-is-it-so-difficult-and-what-can-we-do-about-it/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;attention span shrank due to the&lt;/a&gt; amount of info we are processing, we run away from pain and &lt;a href=&#34;https://heydaroff.info/2021/06/21/meaningful-life/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;crave for only happiness&lt;/a&gt;, we judge people so easily without filtering our thoughts or judgements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s just shortly put everything aside and connect with ourselves, put our attention to our body, feelings, emotions and perceptions. Once we can connect and communicate with ourselves, it is easier to communicate with others as well. One main reason is that when we connect with ourselves, we see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://heydaroff.info/2020/12/28/reflecting-on-the-point-of-living/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;suffering inside&lt;/a&gt;. If we are able to understand and take care of this inner suffering, in our communication with others we do realise that they most likely have their own sufferings and thus creates the empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Meaningful Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Couple of days ago I saw two videos (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJvBfoHDk0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74SN33t3bwA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) that made me go through the topic of living a happy life again. Actually, not really a happy life but rather a meaningful life (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;eudaimonia&lt;/a&gt;), because the happiness is somehow attached to pleasure (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hedonia&lt;/a&gt;) and can be a misleading word if not used within the specific context. I should admit that it is not very easy to pinpoint specific checklist or features of a meaningful life, but stoics have defined a meaningful life as:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mindful Listening - why is it so difficult and what can we do about it?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the COVID lock-down, we&amp;rsquo;ve realized the importance of social interaction even more. Given all the talking and listening, we usually think that we are good listeners. In reality, most of us are very bad at listening, remembering only 25-50 percent of what our hearing senses transmit. Just to make the point clear, at most, on average, only the half of what people tell us we listen to and perceive, the rest we just hear. It does not necessarily mean that we do not care about the people we talk to, but we simply cannot grasp it all. Instead, we daydream about different issue, we tend to formulate responses and try to push our ideas before knowing the whole point the other person tries to make.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trust and Growth Mindset</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a very fundamental level, trust is a bonding mechanism in social interactions. Without it we would not have exchanged any products with each other, let states protect us, be socially proactive, or fall in &lt;a href=&#34;https://heydaroff.info/2021/04/12/power-of-love-and-expectations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;love&lt;/a&gt;. Trust is such an important feeling that makes us open up our vulnerabilities and weaknesses to people whom &lt;a href=&#34;https://heydaroff.info/2021/01/25/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-hope/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;we have no control over&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On an evolutionary timeline, once shifting from nomad bands to &lt;a href=&#34;https://heydaroff.info/2021/02/15/on-investing-and-wealthy-life/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;agrarian settlements&lt;/a&gt; we started to bond together with the same group of people over long-term. Protecting the settlements, cultivating food, hunting, and trading cross-settlements required trust among these civilizations. As we have been betrayed a lot throughout history, we also have built up the self-defense mechanism that keeps the trust at a smart level. The hormone called oxytocin (OT) motivates us to be trustworthy by boosting our empathy for others. Basically, if you treat me well, I will have oxytocin in my brain extracted and synthesized, combined with the impact on my central and peripheral nervous system as well, I will be motivated to reciprocate voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If, as two strangers, we suddenly let our guards down, open our vulnerabilities to each other, feel close and give in to each other, we live the moment of the most exhilarating and exciting experience of our lives. Our hearts pound, our eyes become bigger, we cannot sit quiet, and arbitrary thoughts occupy the cognitive capacity. We listen to our song, remember those moments, try to visualize the eyes, the voice, but only blurred and miss being together. These two feelings, falling in love and separation, changes so much in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Delayed Gratification - is it even worth it?!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to give out something now for a return that we&amp;rsquo;ll get at a later point. We want an immediate pleasure and evolutionary it has been central for our survival. Food, water, sex, and more food were necessary to keep up living and pass on our genes to the next generation. We did not have to care about anything else so much. However, with the dynamics of modern world and as we age, for a greater purpose in mind we are learning to endure the lack of immediate pleasure - delayed gratification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reflecting on why we get angry</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/reflecting-on-why-we-get-angry/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anger is present everywhere around us. If we would like to sum the occasions of us getting angry throughout the day, we may need someone else to lend us their fingers as well to support counting. The situations that spark anger can range from being very trivial to an emotionally significant level, mostly being trivial though. This feeling turns off our reasoning capacity and relies on the judgment of the fire that we feel inside ourselves and does not care about any consequences, at least not at the very moment of its peak heat. Moreover, the fury, if not cooled down, can be ongoing for some time. So, what is the problem? Isn&amp;rsquo;t anger a normal thing? If not, then why do we feel it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It helps us understand ourselves, control out attitude towards life, build resilience to adversities and make solid plans. There is also another important point to understand: there is no meaning on what we do in the future. Whether we work in a company, get married and have children or we build a business empire and control the world. The end is: we all will die and, most likely, never come back or remember anything of this life. So, what&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://heydaroff.info/2020/12/28/reflecting-on-the-point-of-living/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;point of living&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://heydaroff.info/2020/12/28/reflecting-on-the-point-of-living/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hoping&lt;/a&gt; about future?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The uncomfortable truth about hope</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-hope/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hoping&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dictionaries&lt;/a&gt;, hoping is defined as to desire with expectation of obtainment. We hope to always be happy, healthy or successful. These are the desires with the possibility of becoming true. We also hope to avoid some disasters or difficulties of everyday life, namely we fear. So, we can take hoping and fearing as siblings faced with two opposite fates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humans hope a lot and actually most of those hopes are ending with a disappointment, if not a disaster. Main reason for this disappointment is that we are trying to create an expectation about an uncertain future that is in no means under our control, and we do it without thinking of other scenarios that potentially could happen (and eventually does happen). The not happening of what we hoped for is just one source of the distress. There is also a very likely scenario that once we achieve the target, it won&amp;rsquo;t meet our expectations. It&amp;rsquo;s very unnecessary to hope for things, as it is not a value adding exercise. Hope and fear is just a &lt;a href=&#34;https://heydaroff.info/2021/01/04/how-self-reflection-leads/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;product of our mind&lt;/a&gt;. They cannot change anything neither impact the probability of the outcome. It just creates stress, anxiety, depression and disenchantment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are too much occupied. Dealing with daily life issues, working, eating, cleaning, watching Netflix, parenting, etc. There is so much going on and it is not always easy or satisfying. As humans, we go through numerous emotions such as happiness, anger, relaxation, poignancy, which we tend to also express, in one way or another, to outside. The positive emotions that we show to people around makes us likeable person to be companion with. Vice versa, bringing negative emotions out can make a companionship of ours a misery for others. This in return breeds more negative emotions in us, such as depression or melancholy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are craving for a purpose, a meaning, a worthwhile reason for living. Right before sleeping, during the day having nothing to do, in the midst of bad events being depressed - that&amp;rsquo;s when we question the point of living. This question has neither single nor a precise answer. But does it have to have only one and precise answer for it to make sense?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything depends on the individual human being, regardless of how small a number of like-minded people there are, and everything depends on each person, through action and not mere words, creatively making the meaning of life a reality in his or her own being.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/reflecting-on-obstacles-amp-resilience/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2020 probably has been giving us quite enough examples of how hard times look like. Sitting and reflecting on the past twelve months, each of us have had moments of quitting, giving up, hiding or running away. These are very usual phases of human reaction to hardships. It usually starts with a sudden shock of the event due to unacceptability or maybe just the spontaneity of it. Since we did not perceive it in advance, we start with denying it. Slowly this denial turns into frustration about why it happened to &amp;lsquo;you&amp;rsquo;. Seeking answer to this question pulls us to the black hole of depression. We feel absolutely miserable and betrayed by our luck or by God or by ourselves. The final phase, hopefully, is accepting it. That&amp;rsquo;s when we start to get up and continue living. This is such a long process and sometimes we are not able to get out of those phases, especially the depression. Why is that? Even more important question is: how can we control it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reflecting the Way of Zen</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://heydaroff.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/screenshot-2020-12-16-at-14.35.57.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;markdown-image&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://heydaroff.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/screenshot-2020-12-16-at-14.35.57.png?w=503&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;sumi-e painting&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intensity and dynamics of life is changing intermittently. Making plans for the future, describing the things based on the bias of past, and &amp;ldquo;trying&amp;rdquo; to influence the now brings us the frustration of &amp;ldquo;the complexity of ourselves&amp;rdquo;. Alan Watts, in his book &amp;ldquo;The Way of Zen&amp;rdquo;, uses the Thermostat Analogy to explain this frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The system can be paralyzed in yet another way. Every feedback system needs a margin of “lag” or error. If we try to make a thermostat absolutely accurate–that is, if we bring the upper and lower limits of temperature very close together in an attempt to hold the temperature at a constant 70 degrees–the whole system will break down. For to the extent that the upper and lower limits coincide, the signals for switching off and switching on will coincide! If 70 degrees is both the lower and upper limit the “go” sign will also be the “stop” sign; “yes” will imply “no” and “no” will imply “yes.” Whereupon the mechanism will start “trembling,” going on and off, on and off, until it shakes itself to pieces. The system is too sensitive and shows symptoms which are startlingly like human anxiety. For when a human being is so self-conscious, so self-controlled that he cannot let go of himself, he dithers or wobbles between opposites. This is precisely what is meant in Zen by going round and round on “the wheel of birth-and-death,” for the Buddhist samsara is the prototype of all vicious circles. We saw that when the furnace responds too closely to the thermostat, it cannot go ahead without also trying to stop, or stop without also trying to go ahead. This is just what happens to the human being, to the mind, when the desire for certainty and security prompts identification between the mind and its own image of itself. It cannot let go of itself. It feels that it should not do what it is doing, and that it should do what it is not doing. It feels that it should not be what it is, and be what it isn’t. Furthermore, the effort to remain always “good” or “happy” is like trying to hold the thermostat to a constant 70 degrees by making the lower limit the same as the upper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

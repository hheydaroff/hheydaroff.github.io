      <description>I have not written a blog post since long time. Actually the previous post was written on 22.06.2023. That does not mean I have not written anything though. In the meantime, I have published few posts on Linkedin, mostly on the communication of my weekend hustles, certificate achievements, and sometimes commenting on the posts I have read online.
I also have written quite a lot at my work as a Product Manager.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Neurons that fire together, wire together.&amp;rdquo;
 Building habits has never been a strengh of mine. I find it difficult to practice consistently. Not that I do not like the activity itself, but it is quite hard for me to proactively spare time and devotion to that specific activity. I just forget it, or something else grabs my attention away from doing that.
It is my second day of writing in 2024.</description>

      <description>It was another day of reflection Friday. I was looking at my annual, and quarterly targets and checking if my week was contributing to them. It has not yet been a routine for me, but I try to do it every Friday (Tip: putting recurrent Friday blockers on a calendar helps to remind myself).
One of the goals I achieved in 2022 was reading 20 books. Reading helps to keep my mental health fit and learn more about the world and the people in it.</description>

      <description>Flappy Bird is a mobile game that was developed by Vietnamese video game artist and developer Dong Nguyen. The player must tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and fly up, navigating through a series of pipes that appear on the screen. The goal is to fly as far as possible without hitting any pipes or the ground. Each time the bird successfully passes through a pipe, the player&amp;rsquo;s score increases.</description>

      <description>You don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre doing what you‚Äôre doing üîóAt the company I was working at, we had a regular ‚ÄúWriters‚Äô community‚Äù call where people who write blogs, and articles for a broader audience than their self get together and share their best practices, updates, new articles, etc. Participating there also led me to a workshop we had with a professional trainer, where I learned about writing articles in a structured way.</description>

      <title>How to ditch meetings that prevent productivity</title>

      <description>Another meeting invite is in your inbox&amp;hellip; sigh. There are multiple reasons you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to attend it at all: it is the only slot available for working, it is at 7 am/pm at your location, it&amp;rsquo;s at lunchtime, or you do not know what the meeting is about. This gives me a real d√©j√† vu.
We are all going through this turmoil after remote working became a must, thanks to (or more like damn) COVID.</description>

      <title>Psychology of Remote Working and 16 tips to make it work</title>

      <description>Remote working will more likely stay in long term. If not hundred percent, it will definitely push many companies to adopt hybrid model. With the COVID hit, tens of millions of people had to move their workplaces to their living places, to their homes. In multiple studies (mostly by management consulting companies) it is estimated that more than 20 to 25 percent of the workforce could work three to five days a week remotely.</description>

      <title>Prosochƒì - Reflecting on attention</title>

      <description>I have to admit that it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult for me to put my attention onto one thing and keep it there for long time. I am getting distracted very easily from the incoming e-mail, a call, the feeling of hunger, the beeping sound of the Whatsapp and so many other stuff. While trying to formulate my thoughts into reasonable structure I shortly went on Clubhouse to listen to some friends and it took me twenty minutes to get back to the activity of writing this blog post.</description>

      <title>Feeling lazy today and it&#39;s fine</title>

      <description>I was supposed to get this article published on Monday, but didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to finish it before midnight. Instead I just read some articles, listened to some discussions on ClubHouse and slowly started writing. It&amp;rsquo;s not very usual for me in last half a year to take things easy and become lazy whenever I feel like it. That&amp;rsquo;s when questioning kicked in. Why is laziness seen as evil?! Is it really a bad thing to be lazy?</description>

      <title>Reflecting on making mistakes</title>

      <description>Mistakes are perceived as potential threats. It&amp;rsquo;s the fear of vulnerability to existential threats in the harsh world that feeds our mind with the avoidance mechanism against making mistakes. However, yielding too much to this fear of vulnerability hits us with another destructive outcome: seeking perfectionism at all costs. Perfectionism such a delusional will that can turn us into petty-minded, judgmental and unhappy person that we try to avoid originally. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if making mistakes is really bad or not.</description>

      <title>Delayed Gratification - is it even worth it?!</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to give out something now for a return that we&amp;rsquo;ll get at a later point. We want an immediate pleasure and evolutionary it has been central for our survival. Food, water, sex, and more food were necessary to keep up living and pass on our genes to the next generation. We did not have to care about anything else so much. However, with the dynamics of modern world and as we age, for a greater purpose in mind we are learning to endure the lack of immediate pleasure - delayed gratification.</description>

      <title>How does learning help for longer and healthier life?</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s so weird how ignorant we are about aging or living longer. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time I was questioning how I can support my body and mind to live a bit longer and in better health, or even understanding how aging works never occurred to me. Contrary to it, I always conceded that we are mortal and we mostly do not have an influence on the speed of aging.</description>

      <title>Reflecting on the &#34;why&#34; of working</title>
      <link>https://heyhido.com/posts/reflecting-on-the-why-of-working/</link>

      <description>Human beings have been working since quite a long time. Even our primate ancestors worked tools out for hunting of different stones and other materials taken from the nature. So, it should not be such a new concept to reflect upon, thus let&amp;rsquo;s try it. We can put the development of working into three phases: 1) Work, 2) Job, 3) Career.
Once humans shifted from hunter-gatherer nomad bands into agrarian settlements, the design of work changed as well.</description>

      <title>Reflecting on sleeping and learning</title>

      <description>Sleeping less than six hours a day increases the risk of having certain forms of cancer, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease, inconsistency of blood sugar, blockage of coronary arteries, psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, suicidality, obesity and some other things. Sleep keeps our body&amp;rsquo;s metabolic state in balance by fine-tuning the insulin and circulating glucose. A good night&amp;rsquo;s sleep makes sure our gut microbiome is nutritionally plentiful, as well as our brain is refreshing itself.</description>

      <title>Bullet-proof productivity with OKRs</title>

      <description>Back in late 1970s Andy Grove, in Intel, introduced the OKR (Objectives &amp;amp; Key Results), inspired by Peter Drucker&amp;rsquo;s MBO (Management by Objective) method. OKR is a goal-setting method used to define strategic goals and measurable results used by organizations. OKRs help to build a direction and prioritized focus.
As of today there are many companies who have adopted OKRs as their growth compass. The organisation I am currently working at has been also using OKRs since couple of years.</description>
